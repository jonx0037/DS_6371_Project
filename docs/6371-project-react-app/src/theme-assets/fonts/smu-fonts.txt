SMU’s official brand fonts are Trade Gothic (sans serif) and Tiempos (serif). Trade Gothic makes a modern statement and is perfectly balanced by the welcoming Tiempos. Both fonts can be used for headlines and/or body copy.

If Trade Gothic and Tiempos aren’t available to your department, Arial (sans serif) and Georgia (serif) are acceptable alternatives. Both fonts also can be used for headlines and/or body copy.
